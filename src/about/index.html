            <p>
                Hey, thanks for stopping by. My name is David, I'm 21 years old and currently live near Ulm, where I
                attend medical school at Ulm University.
                <br>If you want to, you can follow me and my life on my social media profiles and simply reach out by

            <h3>
                <br>
                Career
            </h3>
            <p>
                Like many others, I started my career with various summer jobs as a highschool student. By working for a
                couple of weeks during my summer vacation, I was
                able to earn some money and spent it mostly on overprized technichal gadgets. Later, I spent half a year
                working at a local dentist, where I did simple tasks
                like cleaning and steralizing instruments.
                <br>After finishing school in 2021, I spent a year as a Corporate Student at Hewlett Packard Enterprise
                studying Business
                Information Systems in Stuttgart.
                Even though I am very greatful for everything I've learned during my time as a Dual Student, I realized
                that I just wasn't following my true passions.
                <br>This is why I took the risk and made the difficult decision to quit my job at HPE and applied for a
                spot as a medical student. Luckily, everything worked out
                in the end and now I am very greatful to be in my first semsester as a med student in Ulm.
                <br>
                <br>To help fund my studies and give a little bit back to struggeling students like myself in middle
                school, I also work as a tutorer at the moment.
